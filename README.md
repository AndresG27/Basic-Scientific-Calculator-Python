There some buttons that resolves the operation without clicking the equal button (the x^2, square root, sin and cos buttons)

For the x^y, % and yâˆš you have to click the base first, then click the button, then you press the number for your subindex (or percentage you want to know)
and then press the equal button, the rest of the operations work as usual.
For now, it can only do calculations with 2 diferent numbers, I will improve this
later on when I learn a bit more, but this is my final project and I hope you like it
